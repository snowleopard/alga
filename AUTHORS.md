The Alga library was originally developed by

* [Andrey Mokhov](mailto:andrey.mokhov@gmail.com) [@snowleopard](https://github.com/snowleopard)

but over time many contributors helped make it much better, including (among others):

* [Alexandre Moine](mailto:alexandre@moine.me) [@nobrakal](https://github.com/nobrakal)

If you are not on this list, it's not because your contributions are not appreciated, but 
because I didn't want to add your name and contact details without your consent. Please fix this
by sending a PR, keeping the list alphabetical.

Also see the autogenerated yet still possibly incomplete
[list of contributors](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga/graphs/contributors).

Thank you all for your help!
Andrey
