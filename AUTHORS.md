If you are not on this list, it's not because your contributions are not
appreciated, but because I didn't want to add your name and contact details
without your consent. Please fix this by sending a PR, keeping the list
alphabetical (sorted by last and then first name).

Also see the autogenerated yet still possibly incomplete
[list of contributors](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga/graphs/contributors).

Thank you all for your help!
Andrey
