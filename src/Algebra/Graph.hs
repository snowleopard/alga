-- __Alga__ is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs
-- in Haskell. See <https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper> for the
-- motivation behind the library, the underlying theory, and implementation details.
--
-- This module defines the core data type 'Graph' and associated algorithms.
-- For graphs that are known to be /non-empty/ at compile time, see
-- "Algebra.Graph.NonEmpty". 'Graph' is an instance of type classes defined in
-- modules "Algebra.Graph.Class" and "Algebra.Graph.HigherKinded.Class", which
-- can be used for polymorphic graph construction and manipulation.

{-| The 'Graph' data type is a deep embedding of the core graph construction
primitives 'empty', 'vertex', 'overlay' and 'connect'. We define a 'Num'
instance as a convenient notation for working with graphs:

    > 0           == Vertex 0
    > 1 + 2       == Overlay (Vertex 1) (Vertex 2)
    > 1 * 2       == Connect (Vertex 1) (Vertex 2)
    > 1 + 2 * 3   == Overlay (Vertex 1) (Connect (Vertex 2) (Vertex 3))
    > 1 * (2 + 3) == Connect (Vertex 1) (Overlay (Vertex 2) (Vertex 3))

__Note:__ the 'Num' instance does not satisfy several "customary laws" of 'Num',
which dictate that 'fromInteger' @0@ and 'fromInteger' @1@ should act as
additive and multiplicative identities, and 'negate' as additive inverse.
Nevertheless, overloading 'fromInteger', '+' and '*' is very convenient when
working with algebraic graphs; we hope that in future Haskell's Prelude will
provide a more fine-grained class hierarchy for algebraic structures, which we
would be able to utilise without violating any laws.

The 'Eq' instance is currently implemented using the 'AM.AdjacencyMap' as the
/canonical graph representation/ and satisfies all axioms of algebraic graphs:

    * 'overlay' is commutative and associative:

        >       x + y == y + x
        > x + (y + z) == (x + y) + z

    * 'connect' is associative and has 'empty' as the identity:

        >   x * empty == x
        >   empty * x == x
        > x * (y * z) == (x * y) * z

    * 'connect' distributes over 'overlay':

        > x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z
        > (x + y) * z == x * z + y * z

    * 'connect' can be decomposed:

        > x * y * z == x * y + x * z + y * z

The following useful theorems can be proved from the above set of axioms.

    * 'overlay' has 'empty' as the identity and is idempotent:

        >   x + empty == x
        >   empty + x == x
        >       x + x == x

    * Absorption and saturation of 'connect':

        > x * y + x + y == x * y
        >     x * x * x == x * x

When specifying the time and memory complexity of graph algorithms, /n/ will
denote the number of vertices in the graph, /m/ will denote the number of
edges in the graph, and /s/ will denote the /size/ of the corresponding
'Graph' expression. For example, if @g@ is a 'Graph' then /n/, /m/ and /s/ can
be computed as follows:

@n == 'vertexCount' g
m == 'edgeCount' g
s == 'size' g@

Note that 'size' counts all leaves of the expression:

@'vertexCount' 'empty'           == 0
'size'        'empty'           == 1
'vertexCount' ('vertex' x)      == 1
'size'        ('vertex' x)      == 1
'vertexCount' ('empty' + 'empty') == 0
'size'        ('empty' + 'empty') == 2@

Converting a 'Graph' to the corresponding 'AM.AdjacencyMap' takes /O(s + m * log(m))/
time and /O(s + m)/ memory. This is also the complexity of the graph equality
test, because it is currently implemented by converting graph expressions to
canonical representations based on adjacency maps.

The total order on graphs is defined using /size-lexicographic/ comparison:

* Compare the number of vertices. In case of a tie, continue.
* Compare the sets of vertices. In case of a tie, continue.
* Compare the number of edges. In case of a tie, continue.
* Compare the sets of edges.

Here are a few examples:

@'vertex' 1 < 'vertex' 2
'vertex' 3 < 'edge' 1 2
'vertex' 1 < 'edge' 1 1
'edge' 1 1 < 'edge' 1 2
'edge' 1 2 < 'edge' 1 1 + 'edge' 2 2
'edge' 1 2 < 'edge' 1 3@

Note that the resulting order refines the 'isSubgraphOf' relation and is
compatible with 'overlay' and 'connect' operations:

@'isSubgraphOf' x y ==> x <= y@

@'empty' <= x
x     <= x + y
x + y <= x * y@

Deforestation (fusion) is implemented for some functions in this module. This means
that when a function tagged as a \"good producer\" is composed with a \"good consumer\",
the intermediate structure will not be built.

{- Note [Functions for rewrite rules]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module contains several functions whose only purpose is to guide GHC
rewrite rules. The names of all such functions are suffixed with "R" so that it
is easier to distinguish them from others.

Why do we need them?

These functions are annotated with carefully chosen GHC pragmas that control
inlining, which would be impossible or unreliable if we used standard functions
instead. For example, the function 'eqR' has the following annotations:

    NOINLINE [1] eqR
    RULES "eqIntR" eqR = eqIntR

This tells GHC to rewrite 'eqR' to faster 'eqIntR' if possible (if the types
match), and -- importantly -- not to inline 'eqR' too early, before the rewrite
rule had a chance to fire.

We could have written the following rule instead:

    RULES "eqIntR" (==) = eqIntR

But that would have to rely on appropriate inlining behaviour of (==) which is
not under our control. We therefore choose the safe and more explicit path of
creating our own intermediate functions for guiding rewrite rules when needed.

{- Note [The implementation of hasEdge]

We fold a graph into a function of type Int -> Int where the Int stands for the
number of vertices of the specified edge that have been matched so far. The edge
belongs to the graph if we reach the number 2. Note that this algorithm can be
generalised to algebraic graphs of higher dimensions, e.g. we can similarly find
3-edges (triangles), 4-edges (tetrahedra) and k-edges in O(s) time.

The four graph constructors are interpreted as follows:

  * Empty       : the matching number is unchanged;
  * Vertex x    : if x matches the next vertex, the number is incremented;
  * Overlay x y : pick the best match in the two subexpressions;
  * Connect x y : match the subexpressions one after another.

Note that in the last two cases we can (and do) shortcircuit the computation as
soon as the edge is fully matched in one of the subexpressions.

{- Note [The rules of foldg]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The rules for foldg work very similarly to GHC's mapFB rules; see a note below
this line: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/src/GHC.Base.html#mapFB.

* All concerned expressions are inlined to allow the compiler to apply the main
  rule: "foldg/buildg".
  This rule states that the composition of a good producer (expressed via buildg)
  and a good consumer (expressed via foldg) can be fused to remove the construction
  of the intermediate structure.

* If this inlining is made blindlessly, it can lead to unneeded operations. They
  are optimized via the "foldg/id" rule.

* composeR is here to allow further optimization. As an high-order function, it
  benefit from inlining in the final phase.

* The "composeR/composeR" rule optimises compositions of multiple composeR's.
