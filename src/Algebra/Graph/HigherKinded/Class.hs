-- __Alga__ is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs
-- in Haskell. See <https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper> for the
-- motivation behind the library, the underlying theory, and implementation details.
--
-- This module defines the core type class 'Graph', a few graph subclasses, and
-- basic polymorphic graph construction primitives. Functions that cannot be
-- implemented fully polymorphically and require the use of an intermediate data
-- type are not included. For example, to compute the size of a 'Graph'
-- expression you will need to use a concrete data type, such as "Algebra.Graph".
--
-- See "Algebra.Graph.Class" for alternative definitions where the core type
-- class is not higher-kinded and permits more instances.

The core type class for constructing algebraic graphs is defined by introducing
the 'connect' method to the standard 'MonadPlus' class and reusing the following
existing methods:

* The 'empty' method comes from the 'Control.Applicative.Alternative' class and
corresponds to the /empty graph/. This module simply re-exports it.

* The 'vertex' graph construction primitive is an alias for 'pure' of the
'Applicative' type class.

* Graph 'overlay' is an alias for 'mplus' of the 'MonadPlus' type class.

The 'Graph' type class is characterised by the following minimal set of axioms.
In equations we use @+@ and @*@ as convenient shortcuts for 'overlay' and
'connect', respectively.

    * 'overlay' is commutative and associative:

        >       x + y == y + x
        > x + (y + z) == (x + y) + z

    * 'connect' is associative and has 'empty' as the identity:

        >   x * empty == x
        >   empty * x == x
        > x * (y * z) == (x * y) * z

    * 'connect' distributes over 'overlay':

        > x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z
        > (x + y) * z == x * z + y * z

    * 'connect' can be decomposed:

        > x * y * z == x * y + x * z + y * z

The following useful theorems can be proved from the above set of axioms.

    * 'overlay' has 'empty' as the identity and is idempotent:

        >   x + empty == x
        >   empty + x == x
        >       x + x == x

    * Absorption and saturation of 'connect':

        > x * y + x + y == x * y
        >     x * x * x == x * x

The core type class 'Graph' corresponds to unlabelled directed graphs.
'Undirected', 'Reflexive', 'Transitive' and 'Preorder' graphs can be obtained
by extending the minimal set of axioms.

When specifying the time and memory complexity of graph algorithms, /n/ will
denote the number of vertices in the graph, /m/ will denote the number of
edges in the graph, and /s/ will denote the /size/ of the corresponding
'Graph' expression.

The class of /undirected graphs/ that satisfy the following additional axiom.

    * 'connect' is commutative:

        > x * y == y * x
-}
class Graph g => Undirected g

{-|
The class of /reflexive graphs/ that satisfy the following additional axiom.

    * Each vertex has a /self-loop/:

        > vertex x == vertex x * vertex x

    Or, alternatively, if we remember that 'vertex' is an alias for 'pure':

        > pure x == pure x * pure x

Note that by applying the axiom in the reverse direction, one can always remove
all self-loops resulting in an /irreflexive graph/. This type class can
therefore be also used in the context of irreflexive graphs.

class Graph g => Reflexive g

{-|
The class of /transitive graphs/ that satisfy the following additional axiom.

    * The /closure/ axiom: graphs with equal transitive closures are equal.

        > y /= empty ==> x * y + x * z + y * z == x * y + y * z

By repeated application of the axiom one can turn any graph into its transitive
closure or transitive reduction.
