-- __Alga__ is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs
-- in Haskell. See <https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper> for the
-- motivation behind the library, the underlying theory, and implementation details.
--
-- This module provides a minimal and experimental implementation of algebraic
-- graphs with edge labels. The API will be expanded in the next release.
