module Algebra.Graph.Relation.Internal (

    Relation (..), consistent, setProduct, referredToVertexSet
  ) where

import Data.Set (Set, union)

import Algebra.Graph.Class

import qualified Data.Set as Set

{-| The 'Relation' data type represents a graph as a /binary relation/. We
define a 'Num' instance as a convenient notation for working with graphs:

    > 0           == vertex 0
    > 1 + 2       == overlay (vertex 1) (vertex 2)
    > 1 * 2       == connect (vertex 1) (vertex 2)
    > 1 + 2 * 3   == overlay (vertex 1) (connect (vertex 2) (vertex 3))
    > 1 * (2 + 3) == connect (vertex 1) (overlay (vertex 2) (vertex 3))

The 'Show' instance is defined using basic graph construction primitives:

@show (empty     :: Relation Int) == "empty"
show (1         :: Relation Int) == "vertex 1"
show (1 + 2     :: Relation Int) == "vertices [1,2]"
show (1 * 2     :: Relation Int) == "edge 1 2"
show (1 * 2 * 3 :: Relation Int) == "edges [(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)]"
show (1 * 2 + 3 :: Relation Int) == "graph [1,2,3] [(1,2)]"@

The 'Eq' instance satisfies all axioms of algebraic graphs:

    * 'Algebra.Graph.Relation.overlay' is commutative and associative:

        >       x + y == y + x
        > x + (y + z) == (x + y) + z

    * 'Algebra.Graph.Relation.connect' is associative and has
    'Algebra.Graph.Relation.empty' as the identity:

        >   x * empty == x
        >   empty * x == x
        > x * (y * z) == (x * y) * z

    * 'Algebra.Graph.Relation.connect' distributes over
    'Algebra.Graph.Relation.overlay':

        > x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z
        > (x + y) * z == x * z + y * z

    * 'Algebra.Graph.Relation.connect' can be decomposed:

        > x * y * z == x * y + x * z + y * z

The following useful theorems can be proved from the above set of axioms.

    * 'Algebra.Graph.Relation.overlay' has 'Algebra.Graph.Relation.empty' as the
    identity and is idempotent:

        >   x + empty == x
        >   empty + x == x
        >       x + x == x

    * Absorption and saturation of 'Algebra.Graph.Relation.connect':

        > x * y + x + y == x * y
        >     x * x * x == x * x

When specifying the time and memory complexity of graph algorithms, /n/ and /m/
will denote the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively.
