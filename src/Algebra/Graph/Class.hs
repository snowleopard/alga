-- __Alga__ is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs
-- in Haskell. See <https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper> for the
-- motivation behind the library, the underlying theory, and implementation details.
--
-- This module defines the core type class 'Graph', a few graph subclasses, and
-- basic polymorphic graph construction primitives. Functions that cannot be
-- implemented fully polymorphically and require the use of an intermediate data
-- type are not included. For example, to compute the number of vertices in a
-- 'Graph' expression you will need to use a concrete data type, such as
-- "Algebra.Graph.Graph" or "Algebra.Graph.AdjacencyMap".
--
-- See "Algebra.Graph.HigherKinded.Class" for the higher-kinded version of the
-- core graph type class.

{-|
The core type class for constructing algebraic graphs, characterised by the
following minimal set of axioms. In equations we use @+@ and @*@ as convenient
shortcuts for 'overlay' and 'connect', respectively.

    * 'overlay' is commutative and associative:

        >       x + y == y + x
        > x + (y + z) == (x + y) + z

    * 'connect' is associative and has 'empty' as the identity:

        >   x * empty == x
        >   empty * x == x
        > x * (y * z) == (x * y) * z

    * 'connect' distributes over 'overlay':

        > x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z
        > (x + y) * z == x * z + y * z

    * 'connect' can be decomposed:

        > x * y * z == x * y + x * z + y * z

The following useful theorems can be proved from the above set of axioms.

    * 'overlay' has 'empty' as the identity and is idempotent:

        >   x + empty == x
        >   empty + x == x
        >       x + x == x

    * Absorption and saturation of 'connect':

        > x * y + x + y == x * y
        >     x * x * x == x * x

The core type class 'Graph' corresponds to unlabelled directed graphs.
'Undirected', 'Reflexive', 'Transitive' and 'Preorder' graphs can be obtained
by extending the minimal set of axioms.

When specifying the time and memory complexity of graph algorithms, /n/ will
denote the number of vertices in the graph, /m/ will denote the number of
edges in the graph, and /s/ will denote the /size/ of the corresponding
'Graph' expression.

The class of /undirected graphs/ that satisfy the following additional axiom.

    * 'connect' is commutative:

        > x * y == y * x
-}
class Graph g => Undirected g

{-|
The class of /reflexive graphs/ that satisfy the following additional axiom.

    * Each vertex has a /self-loop/:

        > vertex x == vertex x * vertex x

Note that by applying the axiom in the reverse direction, one can always remove
all self-loops resulting in an /irreflexive graph/. This type class can
therefore be also used in the context of irreflexive graphs.

        > y /= empty ==> x * y + x * z + y * z == x * y + y * z

By repeated application of the axiom one can turn any graph into its transitive
closure or transitive reduction.
