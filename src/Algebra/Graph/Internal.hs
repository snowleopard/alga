-- __Alga__ is a library for algebraic construction and manipulation of graphs
-- in Haskell. See <https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper this paper> for the
-- motivation behind the library, the underlying theory, and implementation details.
--
-- This module defines various internal utilities and data structures used
-- throughout the library, such as lists with fast concatenation. The API
-- is unstable and unsafe, and is exposed only for documentation.

-- | An abstract list data type with /O(1)/ time concatenation (the current
-- implementation uses difference lists). Here @a@ is the type of list elements.
-- 'List' @a@ is a 'Monoid': 'mempty' corresponds to the empty list and two lists
-- can be concatenated with 'mappend' (or operator 'Data.Semigroup.<>'). Singleton
-- lists can be constructed using the function 'pure' from the 'Applicative'
-- instance. 'List' @a@ is also an instance of 'IsList', therefore you can use
-- list literals, e.g. @[1,4]@ @::@ 'List' @Int@ is the same as 'pure' @1@
-- 'Data.Semigroup.<>' 'pure' @4@; note that this requires the @OverloadedLists@
-- GHC extension. To extract plain Haskell lists you can use the 'toList'
-- function from the 'Foldable' instance.
